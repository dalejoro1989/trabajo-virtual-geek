  Programming Fundamentals Part One
  
Let's put the explanation aside and get to work. To do this we are going to create our first JavaScript code and what it will do is show the message "Hello world!" On the screen.
The first thing to do is create an HTML file. As with CSS, JavaScript only works in a browser if we include it in our HTML. Since in this case we do not want any style, we will create a simple html:
<!--  
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="es">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Mi primer c√≥digo JavaScript</title>
    -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1></h1>
  </body>
</html>

  </p>
  </body>
</html>
